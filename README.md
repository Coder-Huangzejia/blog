## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the blog portal running locally:

1.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have a MySQL database instance running.
    *   Configure the database connection details (host, username, password, database name) in either the `.env` or `.env.local` file
    *   exec the sql at `db/init.sql`

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm i
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üì¶ Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment using platforms like Vercel. Refer to the official Next.js documentation for detailed deployment instructions:

[Next.js with Docker Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker)

This example provides a Dockerfile and configuration that can be used to containerize and deploy the application.

**By the way, do not forget to edit the real database url at `.env` because of the production ! ! !**
